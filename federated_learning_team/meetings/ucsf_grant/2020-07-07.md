- Mostly working with Ionesio on dynamic FL moving back to PyGrid process
- Right now, want to focus on issue about taking the database out of the worker and sending it to the grid node
- Don't see anything blocking right now

**HERICLES**

- Working on static FL issues
- Solved 3 of the 4 issues, including changes to averaging plan, auth with websockets, etc.
