**VOVA**

- Diving into worker API in syft.js, trying to create a plan that can be serialized to TorchScript and a list of plans
- Trying to get a "real-world" plan that works in syft.js

**MIKE**

- Redoing the format of of Threepio
- Really need to get an example done here pretty shortly, perhaps in about 2 weeks
- Perhaps going to add Numpy to the list of supported frameworks
- Working with Vova on an initial real-world plan for testing purposes

**MADDIE**

- Working previously with Karl and Andrew on Protocols, but now shifting focus on PyGrid
- Working on getting an API example going for FL cycles, hosting of models, plans, and protocols, and creating API endpoints
- This work with the PyGrid team should unblock the worker teams to start working directly with PyGrid
- Maybe in about 2 weeks we should have a basic PyGrid API for the mobile and web workers
- Going to work with Mike on a list of commands with Mike on Threepio

**MARK**

- Dropped support for iOS 12 due to a variety of reasons, primarily background tasks

- Should unblock data stitching after WSS is completed
- Madalin is working on FL requests, for authentication and FL cycle request, also working on ping and networking checking implementation

**VARUN**

- The serialization of the new worker API for websocket response is finished. Just initiated the basic syft and jobs API in accordance to the roadmap.
- Currently working on scaffolding job scheduling. PR would be coming in next few days
- After this, will start with implementing the http endpoints for responses. This will help us to download plans, protocols as well.

**JOSE**
