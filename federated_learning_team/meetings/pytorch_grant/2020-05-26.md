**MIKE**

- PySyft work is still close to being merged
- Tests are being rejected likely because we have a skipped test
- Currently updating all of the Python Threepio test suite, after that it should support multi-command translation with tests to prove it
- Then we need to update PySyft slightly to allow for multi-command translation to work

- Doing the data channel stitching messages right now, trying to replicate Vova's work on this

**VOVA**

- Working on autograd tracing, created a unit test that passes, and it was merged
- Working on protobuf to serialize an action that has a list argument, should finish this by tomorrow
- After that, the MNIST example should work again
- Going to work on documentation after that, should look to separate the grid example to make sure the bundled version works correctly
