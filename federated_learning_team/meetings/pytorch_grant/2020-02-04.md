**KARL**

- Trying to sort out the conversion to TorchScript for Plans
- Converting forward pass is relatively trivial
- Backward pass is a bit more complicated than forward
- Ran into issues working with syft types that don't play well with PyTorch JIT
- Working on redoing the hook of PyTorch tensor types, rather than mangle the current hooking logic

**VOVA**

- Data channel splitting and stitching
- Protobuf plans executing in syft.js
- Going to be working implementing the new worker API

**MARK**

- WebRTC client is finished with unit tests!
- Signaling client is finished!
- iOS 12 and 13 socket clients are finished!
- Working on the syft client (the old version with grid.js)

**MIKE**

- Progress on Threepio was a little slow
- Have testing and translation working in basic form!
- This week: a lot of overlapping function names, might want to try some sort of "fuzzy lookup"

**MADDIE**

- Progress on Protocols was a bit slow this week
- Have a branch for extending PromiseTensor in Protocols on PySyft
- Working on having one PromiseTensor pointing to another
- Should we use "dask" for Protocols? Need to do a bit more research.

**VARUN**

- Currently working on implementing syft API with new roadmap
- Most of the functions are dummy functions currently

**JOSE**

- Started working on the protobuf implementation for KotlinSyft

**PATRICK**

- Working on finalizing the roadmap
- Create a slew of issues related to the "epics" of the whole project
- Placed the epics on a GIthub project and organize them accordingly
