**KARL**
- Working with Protobuf in PySyft
- Deep in weeds untangling garbage collection logic from Plans

**VOVA**
- Working on grid.js and syft.js integration of Protobuf
- Blocked by Plans in Protobuf not being finished
- Working with Karl on getting plans working with Protobuf

**MARK**
- Set up iOS project
- Had a few issues with LibTorch, wanted to do two models, one for the forward pass and another for the backward pass
- For tracing of models in Python, we can’t use PyTorch autodiff, but we can use OpenMined’s autodiff function
- Had problems with arithmetic operations, asking on PyTorch forums for a workaround
- Can’t pass one model to another model as a parameter
- PyTorch will release a 1.4 version which might fix a few problems

**MIKE**
- Mostly getting set up on Threepio, our documentation web scraper, this should feed directly into work on the translation library
- Working with Amr on implementing versioning for the translation library

**MADDIE**
- Hell of a lot of demos planned
- Going to get started doing demos in PySyft using VirtualWorkers then move on to syft.js with manual command input
- Needs to provide the weekly joke next week!

**VARUN**
- Proof of concept for training pytorch on android is successful from the android side. We still need to verify whether we are able to generate the torchscript from th pysyft hook. For this I went through the code base to understand how exactly overridden torch methods are implemented, since torchscript records operations when its functions are called. Until the the native torch function gets called somewhere inside the wrappers it should record it. I agreed with Jose on base code structure and need to set up travis for the repo.
- Working on WebRTC implementation as well as testing of the current KotlinSyft library
