**KARL**
- Plans are working... but they break everything. We have a bunch of failing tests that might need to be redone completely anyhow.
- Working through protobuf serialization for plans now

**VOVA**
- Helping mostly with plans
- Working now on decoding plans in Javascript using protobuf
- Working on message chunking in WebRTC

**MARK**
- PyTorch 1.4 released and things are working quite well now
- Still can’t use PyTorch in unit tests on iOS
- Objective-C wrapper is on a separate branch and isn’t really in development
- Why was PyTorch autograd disabled on mobile but allowed on PI? Not totally necessary since we have our own autograd function.
- Have two other people working on the SwiftSyft project!
- Just finished a UI that looks similar to syft.js, also have someone else working on a websocket client
- Working on WebRTC protocol

**MIKE**
- Amr got his first PR reviewed and merged!  Seems very excited.
- Got more Threepio scaffolding done
- Going to beef out our github issues so that Amr and others can work on various problems

**MADDIE**
- Starting to work on new protocols
- Trying to understand current limitations of current test suite

**VARUN**
- Been implementing WebRTC for Android, almost done!
