**MIKE**

- Last week, trying to figure out a way to map from one command to many commands
- Been working with Karl on necessary changes to plans to allow for translating one-to-many commands
- Adding more into the test suite for Python on Threepio
- Going to add Vova as a reviewer for multiple role plans PR

**VARUN**

- Finished implementing the basic structure for battery, network, and sleep/wake status along the basic configuration
- Aren't any big issues remaining in KotlinSyft
- Working on connection speed testing in the FL worker for PySyft
- Waiting to work on the WebRTC integration into the FL worker for PySyft given Ionesio merging his PR

**VOVA**

- Work on MNIST backwards, tracing is working but the traced plan cannot be translated to Torchscript
- There are a few checks for translating to Torchscript, but there's an issue related to how the tensors are hooked into PyTorch

**MADDIE**

- Lots of documentation tickets going on
- Protocols are fairly close, but there's a few PR's in progress and need to determine how state should be handled
- Also running into autograd issues with tensor chaining
- Need roughly another week on protocols before those are ready
- Trying to get a tracing ticket merged for storage, there's a bit of uncertainty about how we're using placeholders
- Working on defining the interface API for how protocols will be used, going to sync with Mark, Varun, and Vova

**MARK**

- Needed to update syft-proto which had some serialization errors
- Found a way to automate the releases with syft-proto, but we may not want to do this
- Charge detection and wifi detection are done
- Going to work on splitting and stitching
