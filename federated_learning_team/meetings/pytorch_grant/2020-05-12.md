**MADDIE**

- Maddie had a great joke today.
- Working on a giant PR for tracing communication actions: get, send, etc.
- Also worked on saving and retieving state to store
- Got a bunch of people interested in documentation, need to sus out who is going to be reliable
- Have a few more PR's for protocols that are waiting
- Hope to have basic protocol documentation next week

**MARK**

- Last week, created a separate project for background execution
- Can run either foreground or background example on the same project now
- Fixed a Swift memory issue - Swift isn't automatically garbage collected, but now this is fixed
- Gonna give Maddie a documentation issue related to background tasks

**VARUN**

- There are 3 guys currently working on documentation tickets, one has already finished
- Connection speed test is finished, but have some weird issue with upload
- Work on picking up configuration class for Kotlin
- Looking to outsource charge, wifi, and sleep/wake detection to other people

**VOVA**

- Struggling with making autograd work with MNIST, but it works with linear, tried to add convolutional (we have implementation in PySyft, but it doesn't work with autograd)
- Need to remove TrainConfig

**MIKE**

- Refactoring plans to contain multiple Roles
- Each translator will create and return Role to be stored in the plan.
- PyGrid will slim down plans when sent to a worker so each Plan should have only a single Role when sent over the wire. This should prevent any issues with the upcoming Protocol work.
