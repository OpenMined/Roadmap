- Crypten Parties need to run the same function: how to send it to them?
      1. Plans
      2. (Ayoub) other strategies: function to source code, but need to check is code is safe & operation whitelisted. Create jails to prevent data stealing. [uses dill library]

YUGANDHAR

THEO
- FSS: 20x faster than SecureNN when latency is added, but maybe un-necessary communication is still necessary ￼
- Work on Differentiable send

**Follow-up:**
- @Adam J Hall Great paper about "How to backdoor FL" where a PySyft implem really would make sense: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.00459.pdf
- @Alan.Aboudib The paper "Differentially Private FL with domain adaptation" (Peterson) introduces the notion of mixtures of experts, attached is a photo of the poster he presented at Neurip FL workshop
