### Recap

- Over 50 people in the writing team ; new design team
- Private Set Intersection multi platform 

### Updates

SUKHAD & MUHAMMED
- Have joined!

ALAN
- Kickstart project with Digital Reasoning 
- Speaking with Ionesio to integrate Syfertext with PyGrid

ANDRE
- Trick with renormalization working for matrix inversion!
- Discussing with Ionesio to integrate work on Encrypted LR with PyGrid
- Contact Adam about network usage

AYOUB
- Long week!
- Sec Id Team: setup docker stuff for cover project
- Crypten: merging our load function with theirs
- TenSEAL: rush because of covid projects: implementation of Private set intersection using SEAL in the literature 
- TenSEAL: Support for vector operations BFV (naive implementation on ints); for CKKS we can encrypt a vector of float. It uses batching : encode several values a single cipher text -> much more optimized!

AJAY
- Commit changes from syftcrytensor 

GEORGE
- Discussed with Karl: should we point the crypten branch onto master ? We wonâ€™t target master because of version incompatibility of python and pytorch in crypten last commits
- Working on plans to have it work correctly using MPCTensor 

THEO
- Crypto Primitive Store V0 
- Function Secret Sharing on Tensor on review!
