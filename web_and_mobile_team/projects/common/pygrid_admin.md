## Introduction

TODO: @cereallarceny, create the designs for the PyGrid Admin UI, here's the screens:

From main roadmap:

Since the user interface is simply a series of static files, hosting may be done by cloning the Github project to any file server. If the network administrator prefers, they may also use any of the various one-click deploy buttons in the Github project. Since the UI is separate from the PyGrid application entirely, the scaling concerns are separated. This project is defined in [much more detail here](common/pygrid_admin.md).
