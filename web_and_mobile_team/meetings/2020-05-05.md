**MADDIE**

- Last week, worked on tracing communication actions... but trying a slightly new approach now
- This is one of the last pieces of getting protocols to work, but still have a big merge with Jason Paumier
- Expecting a PR for PyGrid authentication testing
- Working on integrating intelligent worker selection into PyGrid, going to also be a volunteer

**MARK**

- Finished type mapping to prevent type errors that took place previously, throwing an error now if data types the user is wanting to use isn't supported
- Background execution is running into issues, about 70-80% sure that this logic should be done outside the library in iOS

**VARUN**

- Been working on connection speed test, have finished ping and download, but need to work on upload
- Migrated PyTorch to 1.5 on KotlinSyft, there were a few issues related to batching but it seems to work

**MIKE**

- Merged together actions and operations, need to speak to Karl about making this a breaking change
- Need to see about supporting commands that don't have a direct translation, this is harder than expected

**VOVA**

- Working on Python worker in PySyft, got a basic version of it working and training the model
- Also working on a PR for support of backward() command for autograd calculation
- Next step is to update the MNIST example to remove the hand-done autograd calculation
