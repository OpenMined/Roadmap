- Talking with Varun and Vova about problems with PyTorch
- A few commands on Vova's plan just simply aren't working
- Madalin finished the download and upload speed, also fixed some bugs on PyGrid
- Shifting to focus on other issues instead like background tasks and sleep/wake

**VARUN**

- Updating KotlinSyft with new PyGrid, plan deserialization is throwing weird errors
- Update Readme to have all the reproducable steps to run KotlinSyft
- Jose is working on connection speed
- Moving on to the Python Worker next

**MADDIE**

- We need to do a series of refactors for protocols, there's a new object called a CommunicationAction in PySyft that needs to be done
- Chugging along on protocols and various refactors
- Outsourcing a testing issue to other new committer
- Intelligent pool selection is under way, but will be outsourced to another person

- Working on speed detection and it's finished, but Rollup cannot compile
- Working on this and with Karl for PySyft and Varun for Python Worker

**MIKE**

- Finished integrating Threepio into PyGrid
- Working on migrating Threepio to perform translation in PySyft as a property of the plan instead of a run-time network request
